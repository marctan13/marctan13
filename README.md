ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marc Tan
Currently working as an HR Specialist and aspiring to become a data analyst.
Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, Python, PowerBI/Tableau on my free time through courses from datacamp, coursera,udemy, etc.
I have recently started doing projects hoping to improve on my skills and to share with everyone. Critiques and comments are welcome so I will know what to improve on. You can check my **Projects** Repository for my projects.
I know there are still a lot of stuff I need to learn and practice to become an effective data analyst. Thank you for checking out my profile.
